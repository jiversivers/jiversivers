### Hi there 👋

My name is Jesse Ivers -- some call me Jivers. I am a biomedical engineer by training, but my PhD research led me to computer science. I found out I love the challenge of big-data analytics, particularly using machine learning and deep learning. Now, I am pushing my research more and more to utilize these interests to solve biomedical problems pertaining to cancer treatment. 

I mostly use Python (and Jupyter) and MATLAB, but have dabbled in R, too. I've self-taught the majority of what I know in these languages, and am always looking for an excuse to learn the next. 

The projects you see here are a sample of some of my work over the past several years in research, ranging from simple helper-programs to make my life of data processing easier to experimental deep learning projects. I haven't bothered to use GitHub until recently (since I am a team of 1 for now), so most of these projects look "new," but most are not. I'm currently working on a project in which I am utilizing a high-performance cluster for its powerful GPU, so it was a natural time to transition to Github to make codebase updates on the remote easier. I'm also slowly working on documenting and generalizing my host of MATLAB work for image processing so my lab group can utilize it easier and collabortions will be cleaner.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a DL project to identify metastatic cancer from state-of-the art imaging technology. 🔬
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to improve model training times through model distribution and mixed-precision training. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting side-projects, particualy pertaining to data-analytics of FIT files. 🏃🚴🏻‍♂️
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with good reseources to learn Rust (I hear its the language to beat all languages).
- 💬 Ask me about multivariate histogram analysis of multi-photon-derived images. 😉
